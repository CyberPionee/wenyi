# 02 · Separate the Review conversation protocol from persistence and arbitration

[Index](README.md) · [简体中文](../zh/refactoring/02-review-agents.md)

Status: implemented in slice B. Baseline: `7471256`; implementation preserves the subsequent fix for resumable provider interruptions.

Implementation:

- `review/models.py` owns outcomes, stable identities and segment references; `review/conflicts.py` owns normalization, grouping and applying decisions. Package exports contain only pure types.
- `ReviewTrace` and evidence-query protocols decouple agents from concrete storage and evidence implementations. `pipeline/review_checkpoint.py` retains the existing filename, active-round, atomic-write and event rules.
- `agents/review_actions.py` owns the common action protocol; `ConversationState` owns replayed messages, citable references and request deduplication. Chunk review and `agents/review_arbiter.py` each own their prompts and final validation.

In-memory tests interrupt and resume at all nine durable boundaries. The extraction was checked against captured original snapshots, events and model messages. Recursive architecture tests enforce the new dependencies. Operation IDs, prompts, disk formats, persistence ordering and fallback policy remain unchanged; this is not a change to translation quality or Review termination policy.

Whole-book session/checkpoint coordination remains proposal 01's scope.

## Evidence

[`agents/review_loop.py`](../../trans_novel/agents/review_loop.py) had 1,006 lines at the reviewed baseline: `_ActionLoop.run()` is 300 lines, `ReviewAgentLoop.review_chunk()` 200, and `ReviewConflictArbiter.arbitrate()` 170. The module also contained issue identity, normalization, conflict grouping and arbitration application.

At the reviewed baseline, the concrete `ReviewRunStore` import at line 17 was a storage dependency, not merely a pure review model. `_ActionLoop` loaded and saved traces directly. The architecture test then rejected pipeline imports but did not reject this concrete review storage import. The implemented ports and recursive architecture tests now enforce the narrower boundary.

## Proposed ownership

- `review/models.py`: pure `ReviewOutcome`, `ReviewLoopOutcome`, issue/consistency types and deterministic candidate identity. Move pure types out of `review/run_store.py` and update consumers together.
- `review/conflicts.py`: normalization, conflict grouping and applying validated arbitration decisions. No LLM client or storage dependency.
- `review/contracts.py`: a small typed trace port and evidence-query contract. Trace operations cover loading a conversation snapshot, saving it at a durable boundary, and emitting a diagnostic event; there is no access to formal chapters or book usage.
- `agents/review_actions.py`: the evidence-request/final protocol and conversation replay. Use in-memory `ConversationState` plus the trace port; keep existing request validation and fallback behavior.
- `agents/review_loop.py`: chunk-specific prompt preparation and final issue validation.
- `agents/review_arbiter.py`: conflict-specific prompt preparation and final decision validation.
- `pipeline/review_checkpoint.py`: implements the trace port using `ReviewRunStore`, bound to the current review/round. Agents do not import that adapter.

Avoid a generic “all agents” framework. `_ActionLoop` already shares a real protocol between two callers; extract that protocol without forcing Translator, Polisher or ReviewFixer into it.

## Replay and evidence rules

Preserve completed/fallback trace reuse, inference identity invalidation, replayed message bytes, parsed-response reuse, and reissuing only an unfinished request. Saving before a request, after receiving raw output, after parsing, and after executing evidence must stay at the same boundaries. An abstract port must not batch those writes until the end.

Keep maximum evidence rounds, request deduplication, allowed-ref validation, the final completion marker, chunk-local new-issue limits, and “requery inherited evidence before citing it” arbitration behavior. A vector retriever may later implement the query contract, but retrieved text alone must not become validated kinship evidence without the existing source references and validation.

## Slices and acceptance

1. Extract pure identity/conflict types and functions; remove their old private import paths in all callers/tests.
2. Add the trace adapter, then move `_ActionLoop` with unchanged trace shape and operation IDs.
3. Move the arbiter and trim `review_loop.py` to chunk review.

Use `tests/test_review_agent.py` replay cases: finished and fallback traces, in-flight turns, already-parsed final output, evidence reexecution without another model request, reduced evidence limits, unknown refs and unresolved arbitration. Add an in-memory trace-port fixture and compare every durable snapshot and model message against the current behavior.

Extend architecture tests to reject concrete `review.run_store` imports from agents and recursively inspect any new agent packages. Keep the declared pure review exports explicit. Run Review, routing/resume, usage and architecture tests; run the full suite when wiring proposal 01.
